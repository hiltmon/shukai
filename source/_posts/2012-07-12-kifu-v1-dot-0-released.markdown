[The Shukai Company LLC](http://www.shukaico.com) is very pleased to announce that [Kifu](http://www.kifuapp.com) v1.0.0 has shipped. And our first customers are already happily using [Kifu](http://www.kifuapp.com) in production. We want to thank all our beta testers and beta clients for testing [Kifu](http://www.kifuapp.com) and helping us make such a great product.

But we're not stopping or even slowing down. We have the core platform, and we know it works. We also have many, many ideas and features we wish to add to help you maximize the value you get from [Kifu](http://www.kifuapp.com) in your small non-profit. We're starting on the v1.1 tasks today, we have a v1.2 plan and lots, lots more to come.

Over the next few weeks, we'll be bringing the remainder of our beta customers on board, and adding new customers that registered during the beta. We believe that it's important to ensure that all new customers have a pleasant first experience with Kifu, so we're doing the migrations for them first. Once that backlog is cleared, we'll enable online sign-up for new clients.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to email us at [contact@kifuapp.com](mailto:contact@kifuapp.com) or [contact@shukaico](mailto:contact@shukaico.com).
