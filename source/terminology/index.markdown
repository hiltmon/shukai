## Shūkai

Shūkai (集会, しゅうかい, /ʃu-kaɪ/) is the Japanese word for a meeting or assembly.

## Kifu

Kifu (寄付, きふ, /ki-fu/) is the Japanese word for a contribution or donation.  Another version of Kifu (棋譜) is the Japanese word for a record of a game such as go, shogi or chess. The double meaning was chosen intentionally.
